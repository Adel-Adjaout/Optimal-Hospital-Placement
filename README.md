# Optimal Hospital Placement in an Urban Area

## Overview
This project determines the optimal placement for a hospital in an urban setting to minimize the maximum distance from the hospital to any part of the city.
The solution uses graph theory and shortest path algorithms (Solving a 1-center node problem).

## Key Features
- Represents a city as a weighted graph where nodes are neighborhoods and edges are travel distances.
- Calculates the optimal hospital location using shortest paths and maximum distance minimization.
- Visualizes the city graph and highlights the chosen hospital location.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `networkx`, `matplotlib`
